                            CMaster Command List
                          Updated: February 03, 2006
*=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=*

NOTES regarding SYNTAX and PARAMETERS:

* Parameters enclosed in <> are mandatory.
* Parameters enclosed in [] are optional.
* x|y means x or y.
* <nick> refers to a user's current nickname.
* <username> refers to the username account that a user has registered with CService, not to be confused with <nick>. 
  - For more information about username accounts and how to determine someone's username, refer to the INFO and VERIFY 
    commands.
* All commands shown with the <username> field can also work with a
  nickname by preceding the nickname with an equal (=) sign.
  - For example, consider a user with the nickname ^Test^ and the username Test2K3. 
  - The ACCESS command can be performed on this user in either of these methods:

    /msg x access <#channel> Test2K3
    /msg x access <#channel> =^Test^

  - The first method directly queries X as to whether or not the username Test2K3 is in the channel userlist.
  - The second method has X verify if ^Test^ is authenticated, and if so, performs the ACCESS lookup 
    on his username account, Test2K3.
  - This can be performed with any command that requires a <username>, but will only work if the user is authenticated, 
    otherwise X will reply with "No Match!"
* <pattern> refers to any search string utilizing wildcards (* and ?). 
  - A *!*userid@host string is one example of a wildcard pattern.
  - For example, both the ACCESS and LBANLIST commands accept <pattern>:

    /msg x access <#channel> ?irc*
    /msg x lbanlist <#channel> *.users.undernet.org

  - The ACCESS command would return any usernames on the channel who matched the ?irc* wildcard string.
  - The LBANLIST command would return all bans set for users who had enabled Undernet's virtual hostmask (usermode +x).

NOTE for SCRIPTERS:

* IRC scripts should always use /msg x@channels.undernet.org for all 
  commands, not just LOGIN, to ensure the command gets sent to X in the 
  event of a temporary nick change for X or other unforeseen circumstances
  which could render your script temporarily unusable.

  PART - Tells X to part your channel. To have X remain out of the channel, refer to SET AUTOJOIN.

       /msg X part <#channel>

  SET - Sets flags for your channel.  
      - Flags are special settings that tell X how to behave under certain conditions.

       /msg X set <#channel> <autojoin|massdeoppro|noop|strictop> <value>

  AUTOJOIN - When this flag is ON, X will always join the channel when it returns online 
             (eg. after maintenance or a netsplit).

       /msg X set <#channel> autojoin <on|off>

  MASSDEOPPRO - The maximum deops X will allow a user (see note) to perform within 15 seconds. 
              - Any user exceeding this will be deopped and, if on the channel userlist, suspended for 5 minutes.
              - They will also have a level 25 ban placed on them and will need to unban themselves after the
                suspension expires.

     NOTE: The current version of MASSDEOPPRO only checks when users perform
           deops with the /mode command (/mode #channel -oo nick1 nick2), not with X's DEOP command.

       /msg X set <#channel> massdeoppro <0-7>

  NOOP - When this flag is ON, X will not allow any other users to be opped.
       - However, you and all your level 100+ ops will still have full access to all op commands and after you login,
         you can use X to kick, ban, etc

       /msg X set <#channel> noop <on|off>

  STRICTOP - When this flag is ON, X will only allow authenticated level 100+ users be opped.

       /msg X set <#channel> strictop <on|off>

  JOIN - Tells X to join the channel.  To have X always join the channel automatically, refer to SET AUTOJOIN.
   
       /msg X join <#channel>

  SET - Sets flags for the channel.  Flags are special settings that tell X how to behave under certain conditions.

       /msg X set <#channel> <flag> <value>

     * Flags and Values:
  
  AUTOTOPIC - This flag makes X reset the topic to the channel DESCRIPTION and URL every 30 minutes. 
            - Note that if the channel is idle, the topic will not be reset during that time. (idle = no users joining)

       /msg X set <#channel> autotopic <on|off>

  DESCRIPTION - Sets the channel description (80 characters max), which can be seen in the CHANINFO reply.  
              - If no description text is specified, the current description is cleared.

     Alias: DESC

       /msg X set <#channel> description [text]
       /msg X set <#channel> desc [text]

  FLOATLIM - Toggles the channel "floating limit" feature on or off. 
           - If enabled, X will reset the channel limit (channel mode +l) within a preset margin above the number of users 
             in the channel, and within a preset period of time. 
           - This can help prevent large botnets from joining and flooding the channel.  
           - By default, this feature is off.
           - When enabled, the FLOATLIM flags will be displayed in the STATUS reply.

     Example STATUS reply:
    
 -X- Flags set: FLOATLIM (MGN:3, PRD:20, GRC:1, MAX:0)
    - In this example, FLOATLIM is ON, with a FLOATMARGIN of 3, a
     FLOATPERIOD of 20 seconds, a FLOATGRACE of 1, and FLOATMAX is OFF. 
    
   -  Refer to SET FLOATGRACE, SET FLOATMARGIN, SET FLOATMAX, and SET FLOATPERIOD for more information.

       /msg X set <#channel> floatlim <on|off>

  FLOATGRACE - Sets a grace value for the floating limit feature. 
             - If the difference between the current limit and what the new limit would be is less than the grace value, 
               X will not reset the limit, so that quiet channels are not littered with mode changes. 
             - This value can be between 0-19. 
             - The default value is 1.

       /msg x set <#channel> floatgrace <0-19>

  FLOATMARGIN - Sets the user margin for the floating limit. 
              - The limit that X resets will be: FLOATMARGIN + the current number of users in the channel.
              - This value can be between 2-20. 
              - The default value is 3.

       /msg X set <#channel> floatmargin <2-20>

  FLOATMAX - Sets a maximum limit for the floating limit setting. 
           - When enabled, X will not reset the channel limit higher than FLOATMAX.
           - This value may be from 0-65536. 
           - The default value is 0 (Off).

       /msg X set <#channel> floatmax <0-65536>

  FLOATPERIOD - Sets the time period, in seconds, before X resets the channel limit. 
              - The value may be from 20-200. 
              - The default value is 20 seconds.                            

       /msg X set <#channel> floatperiod <20-200>

  KEYWORDS - Sets the keywords for the channel (80 characters max).
           - Keywords should be separated by a space.

       /msg X set <#channel> keywords [keywords]

       /msg X set <#channel> mode

  URL - You can state the channel's web site URL(s) with this option (75 characters max). 
      - The URL can be viewed in the CHANINFO reply or by logging into http://cservice.undernet.org/live/ then

      - If no URL is specified, the current URL setting is cleared.

       /msg X set <#channel> url [url(s)]

  USERFLAGS - Set the default AUTOMODE for when a new user is added to the userlist.
            - Default value is 0.

  CLEARMODE - Clears all channel modes.
            - Can be used when the channel has been locked up (channel modes +i, +l, and/or +k).

  NOTE:- This is not necessarily the best method to gain entry to your channel, because other people or bots may be opped 
         in the channel that may reset the modes as you clear them.  
       - Refer to the STATUS command for related information.

       /msg X clearmode <#channel>

       /msg X modinfo <#channel> access <username> <new access level>

  AUTOMODE - Changes the automode of a user to one of these specified modes: NONE, OP, or VOICE. 
           - Based on this setting a user can be voiced or opped when he joins the channel, or if the user is already

            in that channel). 
          - Channel Managers wishing to remove themselves will need to purge their channel, or transfer the channel to 
            another user.

       /msg X remuser <#channel> <username>

  KICK - Makes X kick all users matching the specified *!*userid@host mask, but does not kick the person issuing the 
         command if they match also. 
       - Use should be limited to extreme channel flooding or clones. 
       - You may wish to set a ban on the mask, or +i (invite-only) on the channel before issuing the kick to prevent 
         matching users from rejoining after being kicked. 
       - Your username will be placed in the kick message, enclosed in parentheses.

       /msg X kick <#channel> <nick | *!*userid@host> [reason]

           authenticated users for the channel, and whether X is on the channel or not. 
         - Currently authenticated users are shown in a "username/nickname [level]" format. 
         - A user's nickname will only be shown if that user is currently on the channel, otherwise only their username 
           and level are displayed.

  ***- The ability to see channel modes is extremely helpful in case the channel is locked up 
       (channel modes +i, +l, and/or +k). 
     - If the channel has a key  (+k), X will display the current channel key. 
     - You may use the INVITE command to have X invite you into the channel, overriding all current channel modes, 
       or alternatively, you may use the CLEARMODE command to clear all channel modes, then join the channel.

            level, if given. 
          - If a level is not specified, X will use your access level. 
          - You can only suspend someone with access lower than your own. 
          - The maximum duration is 372 days (8928 hours, 535680 minutes :P).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  BAN - Adds a specific *!*userid@host to X's channel banlist.
      - If the user is online, you can specify their nick, and X will automatically ban the *!*userid@host for that user.
      - Bans that cover a broader range than previously set bans will replace the previous bans. 
      - Any user in the channel who matches the ban will also be kicked if the ban level is 75+.

      - The ban level can range from 1 to your own level.
      -  The ban reason can be a maximum of 128 characters. 
      -  If no duration and/or level is specified, the default will be a duration of 3 hours at level 75.

  NOTE: If the banned user has Undernet's "virtual hostmask" (user mode +x) enabled, X is able to see through it to 
        their actual host, so banning their username via *!*@username.* will also ban their actual host.

       * Ban Levels:   1-74 = Prevents the user from having ops (+o) on the channel.
                     75-500 = Prevents the user from joining the channel.

       /msg x@channels.undernet.org login <username> <password>

  NOTE : - You can hide your real IP with /mode nickname-here +x

         - Other users will see this virtual hostmask instead of your actual host/IP address.  
         - CService Admin and IRC Operators can see through +x, as can X.
         - You will always be able to see your true host/IP, of course.

  SHOWCOMMANDS - Shows all the commands you can use on a channel, according to your access level. 
                 If no channel is specified, only level 0 commands are shown.
  
       /msg X showcommands [#channel]

  SHOWIGNORE - Shows X's current ignore list. X automatically sets a 1 hour ignore on anyone who accidentally or 
               intentionally floods it. 

  NOTE: - X will not reply to you if you are being ignored. 
        - If you don't receive replies from X, ask a friend to check the ignore list for you.

       /msg X showignore

  SUPPORT - A method allowing you to confirm or deny support for a channel application which you are listed 
            as a supporter on. 
          - Upon authenticating, X will notify you of any channel applications that you are listed as a supporter on 
            and will also notify you of this SUPPORT command. 
          - Alternatively, you can choose to view the application on the web to see more information about it, post an 
            objection, and confirm or deny your support from there. 
          - The command will not be effective if you are not listed on a channel as a supporter, or a channel does not have
            a pending application on the web.

       /msg X support <#channel> <yes|no>

  VERIFY - Displays whether or not a person is logged in, and if so displays their username, and also indicates whether 
           or not they are an Official CService Administrator, Developer, or Representative, and/or an IRC Operator.

       /msg X verify <nick>
