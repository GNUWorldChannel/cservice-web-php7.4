~ A few words ~
 
  The CSC (Channel Service Committee) gives the opportunity to users 
to manage a channel by registering it and being provided with the X bot.  
This is *not* ownership because the service will only be placed on the channel 
if there is a general demand for it.  It can't be used in channel wars/opwars, 
or in any attempt to "take over" a channel.  The purpose of this service is to 
help users maintain/protect their channels, service which can and will be 
revoked at any sign of abusing from the channel manager/ops.  The channel 
manager is expected to participate in the channel on a regular basis.  If it's 
found that the manager has not logged into X within a period of 21+ days, a vote 
for a new manager is posted for the channel trusted ops (400+).  If the manager 
does not return within this vote period and also the channel ops fail to vote a 
new manager, the channel will be purged.
 
  If you have a specific question regarding the Channel Service mail 
cservice@undernet.org 
 
 
 
 
~ Committee Guidelines ~
 
* Structure of committee, and general aims
 
 
* The Channel Service committee is a volunteer based user group.
 
* The CSC (Channel Service Committee) are in charge of administrating the 
  channel service.
 
* The CSC will attempt to provide stability to a channel.
 
* The CSC will only register one channel per username.  This rule may be relaxed
  at the discretion of the committee for special channels which provide a service,
  such as help channels.
 
 
 
 
~ Committee Procedure ~
 
 
* Standard Registration:
 
 
* Channel applications are reviewed on a regular basis by the CSC 
to ensure the proper information has been included.
 
* The CSC may deny access to registration to anyone that has been abusive of the
  service or of Undernet.  The CSC may also suspend the registration and supporters
  priviledges to any user.
 
 
 
 
* Special Registrations:
 
 
* A channel maybe registered for special events at the request of IRCops or by 
  CSC Administrators.
        
* A channel may also be emergency registered if it is shown that registering the
  channel will add stability to the channel itself.  The channel must still go
  through the posting period. 
       
* All special registrations must be approved by the special registrations group
  within the CSC.       
 
 
 
 
* Involvement in Channels
 
 
* CSC Administrators will only use their administrative access in order to perform
  channel maintenance, to enforce the CSC guidelines, and to aid channels in times
  of need.
 
* CSC Administrators can reasonably act on a channel if it is found to be used by
  abusive users, such as flooders and users engaged in harassment of other channels.
  Action taken may include suspension of problem users and notification to the
  manager, or purging (removal of channel service) from the channel.
 
* Any CSC Administrator/helper that abuses their access can have it suspended or
  removed without notification.
   
 
   
 
~ Registration Process ~
 
 
IMPORTANT: Channel registrations are here to help established channels, 
not to start them.  You should only be applying for a channel if you have a regular
userbase to the channel.
 
 
* Make sure that you have read these guidelines carefully, and are willing to use
  the channel service (X) in conjunction with the rules of use.
 
* Applications are to be submitted through the Channel Service registration page,
  found via the WWW (World Wide Web) as following:           
   - go to http://cservice.undernet.org/live, login using your username and apply
     using the "Register a channel!" form.  If you don't have access to the web page
     for some reason, please visit #CService on Undernet or mail cservice@undernet.org
     and a CSC volunteer should be able to help you.
* Once the application form is submitted, it is automatically checked for the following:  
  a) Everything's all right.  Meaning, the supporters doesn't use multiple usernames,
     they're not known abusers, they're joining on a regular basis, they're joining
     logged to X before joining the channel, etc.
  b) The channel description. 
             
 
  If any of the above checks fail, the form is rejected, stating what parts of the
  form were incomplete or incorrect.  You may then make whatever additions or changes
  which are necessary and try to submit again.
       
 
  After everything's ok and the supporters did a "/msg X support #channel_name yes" it
  goes to PENDING stage.  Pending notification and traffic check.  After PENDING, there's
  READY FOR REVIEW. The application will be checked carefully by CSC members and it'll be
  rejected or accepted. Note: all objections are checked by the CSC members, if the
  objections posted are false or non-sense, they will be ignored.
  
  The registration procedure takes between 7 and 12 days.
 
 
 
 
~ Disclaimer ~
 
 
 The Channel Service will not be responsible for any activity that occurs on the channel.
 Anything that occurs on the channel are the responsibilities of the people involved and
 has nothing to do with the Channel Service, it's Administrators and the Undernet as a whole,
 including the operators that run it.  The guidelines may change without notice.
